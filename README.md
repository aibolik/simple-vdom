# Create your own virtual DOM to understand it

This repo serves the work that is written in this Medium article - [Create your own virtual DOM to understand it](https://medium.com/@aibolkussain/create-your-own-virtual-dom-to-understand-it-part-1-47b9b6fc6dfb)([part 2](https://medium.com/@aibolkussain/create-your-own-virtual-dom-to-understand-it-part-2-c85c4ffd15f0))

It is better if you follow the repo through the steps provided on that article.

For ease of understanding, the steps are divided in branches. Here are the branch names:

- `1-hyperscript-renderer` - show how to build DOM with _hyperscript_ functions
- `2-emoji-list-app` - create simple emojis list app with hyperscript
- `3-dynamic-app-full-rerender` - add some _dynamic_ content, so that you can see how app re-renders fully
- `4-component-rendering` - introduce Components(like in ReactJS), and how we can make them autonomous
- `5-implement-diffing` - implement "diffing" algorithm(_almost_ like in ReactJS) to show the power of virtual DOM
